1. Which configuration of data in a list causes the smallest number of exchanges 
in a selection sort? Which configuration of data causes the largest number of 
exchanges?
"""
# Least = (acending) already in order(smallest to largest), 
# most  = (decending) worst vase, 

"""
 2. Explain the role that the number of data exchanges plays in the analysis of 
 selection sort and bubble sort. What role, if any, does the size of the data 
 objects play? (how does it effect both/ not compare)
"""
# (how does it effect both/ not compare)
# more objects to compare = more swapps to be completed
# selection sort 
# bubble sort


"""
 3. Explain why the modified bubble sort still exhibits O(n^2) behavior on average.
"""
# on average it will not be already sorted
# if it was it would be O(n)


"""
 4. Explain why insertion sort works well on partially sorted lists. 
"""

# insertion points are found easier in the inner loop with the numbers are in some/partial order
